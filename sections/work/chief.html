      There's bit of a backstory but once I get through this there may be a logical
      explanation to their actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to mobilizatin I was sent to a gentlemans' course to learn my skillset
      as a power generator repairman. I learned how to read schamatics, electrical circuts
      and even how to use a cross bow. Mind you this was a two week course. I felt more than
      adquate preforming maintenance service while leaving this course, unfortunatley assuming
      I had access to the service manual.
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated third in my class, however held the second spot uptill the last few
    tests. A slacker came up from behind and dethroned me, lol he was a cool dude.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, we're at the inital stages of mobilization and we're doing night formation. I was
    in line with my unit and the NCOs start yelling things but I'm not paying attention.
    I was too busy saying things to the people in my unit in formation, not paying attention.
     Sgt Smalls starts reading off a list. My name is apart of the first combat repair team.
     "What the fuck is a combat repair team?", my brain races to understand. Combat repair teams
     go out to where the equipment that needs assistance. The thing about generators is that
     they don't come to you, you must go to them.
   </p>

    <p>
      The most experience I've gained thus far was shorting
      a 15kw out and having to order the special double insulated wire and special terminal ends.
      Plus shrink wrap, which is expensive. Though, while in Louisiana during mob training
      I rewired that generator and had it running on the first crank.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most intutive lesson I've learned was with Sgt. Best, swaping out an aux fuel pump for the main.
      Had he not been there I would have no one to talk it out with in the front of chicken coop at crack of god
      damn it was early, an outpost off
      the main base where I was stationed.
