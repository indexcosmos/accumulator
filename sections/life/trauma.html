    <h3>Just Suffered Slight Fracture and Concussion 12.16.16</h3>

      I woke up early on friday, excited to receive my first pay check from a restaurant
      around 9am. I've been working at part-tiem helping with their seasonal parties.
      I am also trying to hold down another job as a front-end developer, however it's
       been a solo educational journey. I have not been able to maintain effective
       communication with my boss due to time differences and
      their varied schedule. It's been difficult for me to get my boss's attention for
      code review, reading articles his was daily prescription.
    </p>


    <p>
      The time arrived, 1pm, when I could finally run down to pick up my check. The
      hours are not posted I worked on the check and they pay me like a personal check
      so it leaves me a bit confused, although I run to the bank to cash it and ask a
      manager if the monthly maintenance fee could be wavied since I haven't been able
      to keep a positive enough balance to afford it. The manager denies me. I drive
      home about to get ready for my shift and park in the driveway, which isn't always
      open because I
      live with others and they have vehicles (one at a time situation). Once I get out
      of the vehicle I trip over the curb, slide on the grass and crash land the back
      of my left head on the pavement. Luckily I was wearing my beanie that still
      holds the initial contact bleeding point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where I was, once I fell, the mailman helped me up and into my home. I immediately
       stopped the bleeding and then proceeded to the worse thing possible
      after suffering a head injury, laid down and fell asleep. I was out till
      midnight or 1am the next day. The pain was unreal. I reached out to friends
    </p>

    <p>
      online and people I trusted. Because of their support I was able to drag
       myself out of my bed and managed to fill a plastic
      bag with ice. Once acquired I laid down in my bed unable to concentrate on
    </p>

    <p>
      anything but the wound I had just incurred. I cried for hours it seemed
      like, the pain was unmanageable. Once I fell asleep I keep waking up like
       every hour till almost noon the following day.
    </p>

    <p>
      What amazes me most at this moment is not only am I still alive but I
       handled myself enough to stay alive. Since the incident I have found dried
      blood in my ears, including today 12.16.16. I know I suffered a massive
      trauma however I know I am capable to rise above this injury.
    </p>

    <p>This isn't the first time I had a head injury.</p>
